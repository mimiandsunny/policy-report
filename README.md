# FiniteAutomation and Threshold Evaluation Project

## Features

### 1. Binary Classification Threshold Evaluation
- Finds the best threshold that meets a specified recall requirement.
### 2. Finite State Machine (FSM)
- Define states, input alphabets, initial state, and final states.
- Add transitions between states based on input symbols.
- Validate input strings against the FSM.
- Handle invalid transitions and inputs gracefully.
- testing used FSM compute to the remainder when the represented value is divided by
three.
